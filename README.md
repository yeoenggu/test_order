    Here's how "First Sales" is typically used:
    Say you spend a bit of money on Facebook Ads to drive traffic to a particular product page on your store.
    When a prospect clicks on your ad and arrives at the product page, he/she will likely spend a significant amount of time looking/interacting with the product's photo if the prospect is interested in the product.  The app will track the amount of time the product's photos are interacting with the photos.  If there is significant interest, the app will offer a good offer for the new visitor in the sales pop-up.  The app will check whether the visitor is a new prospect or an existing customer.  Offer is only presented to the visitor or logged-in customer who has yet to make a single purchase.

        -Sales popup designed to acquire new customers
          First Sales was designed to acquire new customers.  As compared to a general-purpose sales pop-up, that app will deliver better conversion.
      - track genuine interest by tracking how long customer is looking at the products' photos
        Typical sales pop-up track how long the customer is on the website.  If the customer stays on a website beyond a predetermined threshold, the sales pop-up will appear.  
        Instead of time spent on the website, the app uses time spent on the product's photos.  

        If the visitor spends time looking at the photos, it is likely that they are interested.  
        A Sales Popup with a good offer at that moment may help to close the deal.

        
        
        
      
      - 1-click buy button
        1-click buy button will bring visitor straight to Shopify's checkout page.  It reduces sales fiction as it skipped the "add to cart" portion of the checkout process.

        The app will use the currently selected option and it will work with single or multiple product variants. 
        It is also tested on popular themes.  It uses jQuery to retrieve the selected product variant.  It will not work with a heavily customized theme that uses Angular or other similar frameworks.

I am building a Shopify App called “First Sales and I need icons and banners created. 
The app is a promo bar that is shown to engaged visitor with 1-click buy button.  The aim is to offer 

Please see the following url for icons that I like.
https://dribbble.com/shots/2858193-R-Gift-Logo-Mark


– Colors: Something that is appealing but also stands out. I am thinking a base of Red or Orange, with 1-2 additional colors.
– Format: .jpg, .png (whichever looks best)
– No rounded corners, no white background
– Icon should have a simple graphic that conveys “Gifts” or love for customer. Good gifts wrapping show love and considerations for the customer.  That is the emotion that comes to mind with the very first order a store gets from the customer.  Need 120px x 120px, 60px x 60px, 16px x 16px.

– Banners should have a heading: “First Sales” (no quotes), and sub-heading: “Welcome Newcomers Promo Bar with 1-click buy button”. Sizes: 680px x 300px, 310px x 100px.
– I’d like source files to modify if needed, such as changing the subheading text.

# test simulation for js jquery

1) manually grep the generated js.
2) augment it like following with the var declaration and console.log

var productUrl = "";
var enabled = false;

function isNumeric(n) {
      return !isNaN(parseFloat(n)) && isFinite(n)
    }

var loadProductUrl = function($) {

      console.log("running");
      var form = this.$("form[action='/cart/add']");
      var variant_id = this.$('input[name^=id]:checked, select[name^=id], input[name^=id], hidden[name^=id]', form).val();
      if (typeof variant_id == 'undefined') {
        // They have customized the form.  We cannot support it.
        enabled = false;
        console.log("Not enabled.  Cannot find the form");
      } else if ((variant_id == null) || (variant_id == "")) {
        // form is supported but there is no option selected.
        
        // var option_1 = this.$('option[value]', form).val();
        // Select the option that is selected
        // https://www.allbirds.com/products/mens-wool-runners?variant=40210878599
        // $('option[selected]', form).val()

        var option_1 = this.$('option[selected]', form).val();
        if ((typeof option_1 != 'undefined') || ( option_1 == "")){
          // We do not know how to grep the selected option
          // try to grep the first or the last option
          option_1 = this.$('option[value]', form).val();
          if (typeof option_1 == 'undefined') {
            enabled = false;
            console.log("Not enabled.  Cannot grep the option");
          }
          else {
            if (!isNumeric(option_1)) {
              // if the first option is not a valid variant id, we grep the last one.
              option_1 = this.$('option[value]', form).last().val();
              console.log("Grep the last option");
            }

            enabled = true;
            productUrl = "/cart/" +  option_1 + ":1";
          }
        } else {
          enabled = true;
          productUrl = "/cart/" +  option_1 + ":1";
          console.log("Got the selected option");
          // The reason for retry is that I pick the first option if nothing is selected.  
          // In the event, customer select some option later.  I should check again.
        }
      } else {
        // this is the case where we can grep the variant normally.
        enabled = true
        productUrl = "/cart/" +  variant_id + ":1";
        console.log("Normal grep.")
