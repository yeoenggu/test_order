                    <p>The app focus on acquiring new customers for your store.  Since the customer is new, you would offer a significant discount to entice him/her.  In addition, it is likely that the new customer would make a single purchase.  This is because the customer is just trying out the store.  Thus, it make sense to offer a discount based on a single purchase, automatically apply the discount and bring the customer to checkout immediately.</p>

                    <p>First, we need a discount code that limit the customer to 1 use only.  This is because it should be a special discount just for new customers.  If it is can be used more than once, it would not be special.  Second, we need the discount to be active and no end date.  This make it easy for management.  Do not worry about control since it is already limited to 1 use per customer and you can disable the discount code when you uninstall the app.</p>

                    <p>It can be any value from 10 seconds to 60 seconds.  It depends on how aggressive or conservative you want to be.  Please consider it carefully together with the discount and strike a balance.  If you have Google analytics installed, you can use the avg. session duration of your channel/landing page to help you make a decision.  Otherwise, leave it to use the default value.</p>
